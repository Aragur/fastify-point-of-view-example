# Fastify point-of-view handlebars layout example

This is a example usage of a layout usage using handlebars (as it is intended).  
This is currently not working.  
In the `views/layouts` direcotry there should be layouts that will be used (`main.hbs` by default).  
Using this layout, every view will be populated.

To test the application run the following commands:
```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
